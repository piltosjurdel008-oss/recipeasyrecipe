    <h2>Simple Tips for the Best Results</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh chicken and broccoli give the best taste and texture. Frozen broccoli can be used, but lightly steaming it first prevents sogginess.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Chicken:</strong> Overcooked chicken becomes dry. Cook it just until done, then let it finish baking in the casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese Matters:</strong> A mix of Swiss, cheddar, or Gruyère cheeses can elevate the flavor. For a lighter option, try part-skim mozzarella or a little cream cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Topping Options:</strong> Add breadcrumbs mixed with butter for a crunchy top, or simply sprinkle extra cheese for a gooey finish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variations You Can Try</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extra Veggies:</strong> Add carrots, peas, or cauliflower for more color and nutrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Spicy Twist:</strong> A pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes in the sauce adds a subtle kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighter Version:</strong> Substitute Greek yogurt or low-fat sour cream for a healthier creamy sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Option:</strong> Skip breadcrumbs or use gluten-free breadcrumbs for a gluten-free casserole.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fluffy rice or quinoa</li>
        <li>Garlic bread or crusty rolls</li>
        <li>A fresh green salad</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 2–3 days, making it a convenient meal prep option. Reheat gently in the oven to maintain the creamy texture.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p><strong>Q1: Can I use frozen chicken?</strong><br>A1: Yes, but thaw completely and cook before adding to the casserole for best results.</p>
    <p><strong>Q2: Can I make this ahead of time?</strong><br>A2: Absolutely! Assemble the casserole, cover, and store in the fridge for up to 24 hours before baking.</p>
    <p><strong>Q3: What’s the best cheese for a creamy sauce?</strong><br>A3: Swiss, cheddar, and Gruyère work well. Mixing cheeses adds depth of flavor.</p>
    <p><strong>Q4: Can I make it dairy-free?</strong><br>A4: Yes, plant-based cheese and dairy-free yogurt or mayo work as substitutes.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This comforting chicken and broccoli casserole is simple, satisfying, and perfect for any occasion. The Barefoot Contessa Chicken Divan Recipe delivers creamy, cheesy goodness with tender chicken and fresh broccoli that everyone will love.</p>
